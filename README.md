# :potted_plant: Smart Plant Monitoring with Alert System

This project is created by Cabiling's group from SBIT3H section in Quezon City University. This aims to provide a hardware device that monitors a plant alerting an individual about the state whether it is dry or wet. The device monitors the plant base on the soil state, room humidity, and temperature.


## Tools and Softwares

Arduino IDE with Libraries

Tinkercad (Optional)
